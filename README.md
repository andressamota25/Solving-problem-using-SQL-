Lost Packages Investigation

Project Overview

This project focuses on investigating three missing package cases using SQL queries to track their locations. The process is documented in log.sql, with final findings recorded in answers.txt. The objective is to analyze structured data using SQL and effectively document the investigation process.

Case Descriptions

1. The Lost Letter

Sender: Anneke (900 Somerville Avenue)

Recipient: Varsha (2 Finnegan Street)

Item: Congratulatory letter

Objective: Determine whether the letter was successfully delivered and, if not, locate its current status.

2. The Devious Delivery

Sender: Unknown (previously from Fiftyville)

Recipient: Associate (location unspecified)

Item: A package with unknown contents

Objective: Identify the whereabouts of the package and establish its intended destination.

3. The Forgotten Gift

Sender: Grandparent (109 Tileston Street)

Recipient: Granddaughter (728 Maple Place)

Item: Birthday gift

Objective: Trace the package’s delivery route and determine the reason for the delay.

Repository Contents

log.sql - A chronological record of SQL queries used during the investigation, with explanatory comments.

answers.txt - A summary of findings, including package locations and contents.

database.db (optional) - A database file that can be used to replicate the queries and verify results.

How to Use

Load the provided database into a SQL environment (such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL).

Execute the queries in log.sql sequentially to follow the investigative process.

Review answers.txt for final conclusions regarding each package’s status.
